This project is a static Bus Pass Application form developed using only HTML. It allows users to input personal details such as name, age, gender, route, and ID proof through a structured form. Since no backend or JavaScript is used, the form does not process or store data. It is mainly useful as a UI prototype or printable form, showcasing how a real bus pass system could look before adding dynamic features.
